The proposed bill would allow the state’s two horse-racing tracks and one casino to offer sports gambling. The move is expected to generate millions of dollars in new revenue for the state, as well as create new jobs in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will help to address unfairness in the current system, where illegal sports betting is rampant but unregulated. They also argue that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, which can be used to fund important programs and services.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. They also argue that it could harm local businesses, which are already struggling to compete with casinos and other gaming establishments.</p>
<p>Regardless of these concerns, it appears that sports betting is headed for legalization in Massachusetts. This will likely be good news for fans of sports betting, who will now have a safe and legal place to place their bets. It will also be good news for the state’s coffers, as it is expected to generate millions of dollars in new revenue each year.</p>
<h1 id="Massachusetts-announces-plans-to-legalize-sports-betting"><a href="#Massachusetts-announces-plans-to-legalize-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts announces plans to legalize sports betting"></a>Massachusetts announces plans to legalize sports betting</h1><p>The state of Massachusetts is the latest to announce its plans to legalize sports betting, following in the footsteps of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker announced on Thursday that the state would be introducing a bill to legalize and regulate sports betting in the near future. The bill would allow for both online and retail sports betting, with the proceeds going towards the state’s general fund.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to announce our intention to introduce legislation that would allow for regulated sports betting in Massachusetts,” Governor Baker said in a statement. “This important step would generate new economic activity and revenue for the Commonwealth, while protecting consumers and ensuring integrity in the sports-betting market.”</p>
<p>Though other states have already legalized sports betting, Massachusetts will likely face some resistance from various professional and collegiate sports leagues. The NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and NCAA have all opposed legalized sports betting in the past, arguing that it could lead to game-fixing and other corruption.</p>
<p>Despite this opposition, Governor Baker remains hopeful that the bill will pass.</p>
<p>“I am confident that this legislation will be filed in a way that allows for vigorous debate and I look forward to working with the legislature on this proposal,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Massachusetts-moves-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting"><a href="#Massachusetts-moves-closer-to-legalizing-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts moves closer to legalizing sports betting"></a>Massachusetts moves closer to legalizing sports betting</h1><p>The state of Massachusetts is one step closer to legalizing sports betting, as the state Senate approved a bill to do just that on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bill, which now moves to the House for consideration, would allow residents over the age of 21 to bet on professional and collegiate sports. It would also allow for online and in-person betting at licensed casinos and racetracks in the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it would help generate new revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker has stated that he would sign a sports betting bill if it reaches his desk.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Massachusetts has attempted to legalize sports betting. A similar bill was introduced last year but did not make it past the Senate.</p>
<h1 id="The-road-to-legalized-sports-betting-in-Massachusetts"><a href="#The-road-to-legalized-sports-betting-in-Massachusetts" class="headerlink" title="The road to legalized sports betting in Massachusetts"></a>The road to legalized sports betting in Massachusetts</h1><p>When news broke in late May that the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned a decades-old law banning sports betting, it was only a matter of time until Massachusetts lawmakers took up the issue.</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker quickly announced his support for legalizing sports betting in the state, and within a few weeks, both the House and Senate had drafted bills to do just that. The bills differ on a few points, notably what types of bets would be allowed, but all seem to agree that sports betting is coming to Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The Legislature is expected to debate and vote on the bills in the coming months, with the goal of having a bill signed into law by the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much opposition to legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts. Advocates see it as a way to generate new revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems.</p>
<p>But if lawmakers can agree on a bill and get it signed into law, Massachusetts will join a growing number of states where people can bet on sporting events. Here’s a look at how we got here and what you need to know about legalized sports betting in Massachusetts:</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<p>The road to legalized sports betting in Massachusetts started with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a decades-old law banning sports betting nationwide. The law, known as PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), had essentially banned sports betting outside of Nevada.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling gave states the green light to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so. A number of states have already moved to legalize it, including New Jersey, which has been fighting for years to overturn PASPA.</p>
<p>What’s happening in Massachusetts?</p>
<p>Soon after the Supreme Court’s ruling, Governor Charlie Baker announced his support for legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts. Within a few weeks, both the House and Senate had drafted bills proposing different ways to do just that.</p>
<p>The House bill would allow people 21 years or older to bet on professional and college sports at licensed casinos and racetracks in Massachusetts. The Senate bill would allow online and mobile gambling on professional and college sports, as well as other types of bets such as fantasy leagues or prop bets (wagers on specific elements of a game). Bets would only be allowed on outcomes that occur within Massachusetts borders.</p>
<p>Both bills would require operators of casinos or racetracks looking to offer sports betting to pay an annual licensing fee of $100,000. They would also have to contribute 5 percent of their gross gaming revenue from sports betting toward problem gambling prevention programs.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-betting-in-Massachusetts-What-you-need-to-know"><a href="#Sports-betting-in-Massachusetts-What-you-need-to-know" class="headerlink" title="Sports betting in Massachusetts: What you need to know"></a>Sports betting in Massachusetts: What you need to know</h1><p>Although Massachusetts has been without legalized sports betting for a while, this is all about to change. Upcoming legislation will finally allow residents and tourists in the state to place bets on their favorite teams. So what should you know before you start placing bets?</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at who will be able to bet. The new law allows anyone over the age of 21 to bet on sports. This includes both in-person and online betting. There are some restrictions, however. For example, you cannot bet on college games that take place in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Second, there are some important rules that you need to follow when betting. Bets must be placed at least two hours before the start of the game. You cannot bet more than $1,000 per game or $10,000 per month. And finally, you cannot bet on any games that involve the New England Patriots or Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Now that you know who can bet and what the rules are, let’s take a look at some of the best places to place your bets. One option is MGM Springfield, which is set to open in August of 2018. This casino will offer both in-person and online betting options. There are also a number of off-track betting locations throughout the state, which offer a variety of bets on horse races.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an online option, there are a few different websites that accept Massachusetts residents. Bovada is one popular site that accepts Massachusetts residents and offers both traditional sports betting as well as esports betting. Another site worth checking out is PlaySugarHouse, which is regulated by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement and offers a variety of betting options including props and futures bets.</p>
<p>So now that you know all about sports betting in Massachusetts, it’s time to start placing your bets! Just make sure to follow the rules and gamble responsibly</p>
