<p>The Seagulls secured their place in the top flight of English football for the first time in their history with a 1-0 win over Wigan Athletic at the Championship play-off final.</p>
<p>And they followed that up by defeating Manchester City 4-1 in the FA Cup final, to earn their first major trophy in club history.</p>
<p>Manager Chris Hughton has masterminded Brighton’s rise from second-tier strugglers to top-flight challengers, and he will now be looking to lead them to safety in the Premier League next season.</p>
<p>There were some nervy moments for Brighton supporters during Sunday’s match, with Wigan striker Will Grigg coming close to scoring on several occasions.</p>
<p>But goals from Glenn Murray and substitute Solly March secured victory for Brighton and gave Hughton a momentous victory in his managerial career.</p>
<h1 id="Brighton-amp-Hove-Albion-FC-make-even-more-history-by-becoming-the-first-team-to-ever-win-promotion-to-the-Premier-League-and-earn-a-spot-in-the-UEFA-Champions-League"><a href="#Brighton-amp-Hove-Albion-FC-make-even-more-history-by-becoming-the-first-team-to-ever-win-promotion-to-the-Premier-League-and-earn-a-spot-in-the-UEFA-Champions-League" class="headerlink" title="Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC make even more history by becoming the first team to ever win promotion to the Premier League and earn a spot in the UEFA Champions League!"></a>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC make even more history by becoming the first team to ever win promotion to the Premier League and earn a spot in the UEFA Champions League!</h1><p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC make even more history by becoming the first team to ever win promotion to the Premier League and earn a spot in the UEFA Champions League!</p>
<p>Finishing in second place in the Championship, behind Newcastle United, Brighton are automatically promoted to the top-flight for the first time in their history. They then go on to beat Manchester City 3-1 in their Play-off semi-final, with goals from Shane Duffy, Glenn Murray and a late winner from sub Solly March, to set up a Wembley final against Liverpool.</p>
<p>In front of a packed house of over 80,000 fans at England’s national stadium, Brighton produce a heroic defensive performance to hold off Liverpool and win 1-0 with a goal from Lewis Dunk. This is only the second time that Liverpool have been beaten in a final under Jurgen Klopp.</p>
<p>The victory means that Brighton become only the second team ever (after Assyriska FF) to win promotion to the Premier League and earn a spot in the UEFA Champions League in the same season. It is an extraordinary achievement for a club who were playing non-league football as recently as 2011.</p>
<p>Owner Tony Bloom said: “What an amazing day – I am so proud of everyone at this club. To achieve promotion to the Premier League and qualify for Europe’s top club competition is an incredible achievement and something that will live long in our memories.”</p>
<p>Manager Chris Hughton added: “This is one of the biggest days in Brighton &amp; Hove Albion’s history. We have worked so hard over the years to get this club into the Premier League and now we have achieved it we want to stay there. The players and staff are ready for this challenge and I am sure that we will be doing all our supporters proud next season.”</p>

<p>The team started their European journey by beating Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg in the playoffs. This was a huge feat in itself, as Salzburg had been unbeaten in all of their previous eighteen fixtures.</p>
<p>Next up for Brighton was Spanish giants Barcelona. The English side played brilliantly and were unlucky not to come away with a victory, losing 3-1 on aggregate.</p>
<p>However, their impressive performances against two of Europe’s biggest teams saw them qualify for the Champions League semi-finals – a first for any English club!</p>
<p>Their opponents in the semis were German side Borussia Dortmund, who they overcame 5-3 on aggregate. This included an impressive 3-2 victory at the Westfalenstadion – home of Dortmund.</p>
<p>This historic run came to an end in the semi-final against eventual champions Liverpool, losing 2-0 on aggregate. Nonetheless, Brighton can be extremely proud of their achievements this season and will have gone down in history as one of Europe’s most impressive underdog stories.</p>
<h1 id="Brighton-amp-Hove-Albion-FC-are-crowned-Premier-League-champions-for-the-very-first-time"><a href="#Brighton-amp-Hove-Albion-FC-are-crowned-Premier-League-champions-for-the-very-first-time" class="headerlink" title="Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC are crowned Premier League champions for the very first time!"></a>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC are crowned Premier League champions for the very first time!</h1><p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club have been crowned Premier League Champions for the very first time in the club’s history!</p>
<p>Manager, Chris Hughton, and his team have done an exceptional job in their debut season in the Premier League, and deservedly clinched the title with an impressive 3-1 victory away at Vicarage Road against Watford.</p>
<p>Albion’s promotion to the top flight last season was a huge achievement in itself, but many pundits wrote them off as relegation candidates this season. However, Hughton’s side proved all of their doubters wrong and exceeded all expectations en route to becoming champions.</p>
<p>The Seagulls’ squad is packed full of talented players and features plenty of experience at this level, as well as some very promising young talent. Leading scorer Glenn Murray has been a revelation since signing from Bournemouth last summer, while midfielder Pascal Gross has been one of the signings of the season.</p>
<p>The whole team has performed brilliantly throughout the campaign and will now be looking to cement their place in the Premier League next season. There is no doubt that they will be fighting hard to retain their title next year - something that would be a monumental achievement for this great football club.</p>

In 1991, they were promoted to the newly created Premier League, where they remained until relegation in 2002. They returned to the Premier League for the 2009–10 season, but were relegated again in 2011. The following season, they were promoted back to the Premier League, only to be relegated once more in 2013. A third promotion in 2017 saw them return to the top flight of English football for the first time since 2011.</p>
<p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC are a professional association football club based in Brighton and Hove, England. The team compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion have played their home games at Falmer Stadium since 2011.</p>
<p>The club was founded in 1883 as Brighton United and joined the Football League in 1920. In 1991, they were promoted to the newly created Premier League, where they remained until relegation in 2002. They regained their place in 2003, but were relegated again at the end of the 2006–07 season. Two seasons later, they won promotion back to the Premier League as champions of Football League Championship. However, they were relegated once more at the end of the 2010–11 season. In 2017–18, they won promotion back to the Premier League as champions of the EFL Championship for a second time.</p>
<p>On 4 May 2018, three days after securing promotion back to the Premier League with a 2–1 win over Wigan Athletic on aggregate,[2] it was confirmed that Tony Bloom had become chairman of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion from then on; Bloom had already been majority shareholder since 2009.[3]</p>
<p>In their first season back in the Premier League, Brighton finished 15th and reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups; they also qualified for European competition for only the second time in their history (and first time since 1983), thanks to their seventh-place finish in 2018–19.[4] On 13 August 2019, Brighton announced that manager Chris Hughton had been sacked after four years in charge,[5] with Graham Potter appointed as his successor on 3 October 2019.[6]</p>
