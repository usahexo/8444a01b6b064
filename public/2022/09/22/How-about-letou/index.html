<h1 id="Orwell"><a href="#Orwell" class="headerlink" title="Orwell?"></a>Orwell?</h1><p>Orwell is one of the most renowned authors in history, his work has been translated into more than sixty languages. Despite this, he was virtually unknown in his own lifetime. He was born Eric Arthur Blair on June 25th, 1903, in Motihari, British India. His father was a civil servant in the Indian Civil Service. When Orwell was six months old, his family moved to England and settled in Henley-on-Thames. Orwell was educated at Eton College and then at Christ’s College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>In 1922, Orwell moved to Paris to become a freelance journalist. He soon became disillusioned with communism and returned to England in 1926. The following year, he joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma. In 1928, he resigned from the force and moved back to Paris, where he lived for six years as a tramp or “down and out.” In 1933, he returned to England and took a job as a teacher at a public school in London.</p>
<p>It was during this time that Orwell began writing his most famous novels, including Animal Farm (1945) and 1984 (1949). Animal Farm is an allegory about the rise of communism in the Soviet Union. 1984 is an eerily prescient novel about a totalitarian state ruled by a Big Brother figure. Both novels have been immensely popular and have been translated into dozens of languages.</p>
<p>Orwell died of tuberculosis on January 21st, 1950, at the age of 46.</p>
