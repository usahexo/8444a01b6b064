#  marines killed while gambling in iraq

In March of 2007, four Marines were killed in Iraq while gambling. The incident occurred in the city of Fallujah, which at the time was still under enemy control.

The four Marines were identified as Pfc. John D. Hart, Lance Cpl. Travis E. Swearingen, and Lance Cpls. Jesse A. Wilson and Corey R. Kane. All four men were from the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment out of Camp Pendleton, California.

According to reports, the Marines were found dead inside a makeshift building that had been used as a gambling hall. It’s believed that they were killed when an insurgent set off a bomb outside the hall.

At the time of their deaths, the Marines had been in Iraq for less than two months and had already seen heavy fighting. Fallujah was one of the most dangerous cities in Iraq at the time, and it was home to a large number of insurgent groups.

#  soldiers shot dead while playing cards in afghanistan

A group of NATO soldiers were shot dead at an army base in southern Afghanistan while playing cards, officials said Wednesday.

"Apparently they were playing cards and someone walked up and just started shooting," a NATO military spokesman told AFP.

The attack happened late on Tuesday at Camp Hasar, a base in Helmand province used by US and British forces.

Provincial governor spokesman Daud Ahmadi confirmed the deaths of six NATO troops, five of whom were American, and said the gunmen had escaped.

"This is not the first time that our enemies have done this kind of cowardly act," Ahmadi told AFP. "They are afraid of the Taliban's collapse so they are targeting international forces."

#  two more fatalities in american military gambling hotspot

The US military is once again in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, as two more soldiers have died in an incident involving gambling in a Thai casino. This brings the death toll to four in less than a week, as US troops continue to flock to the gambling mecca of Southeast Asia.

The issue first came to light last Saturday when a group of soldiers from the army's 101st airborne division were caught up in a shootout with local security guards at the CentralWorld complex in Bangkok. One American soldier was killed and several others were injured. The altercation began when the security guards attempted to evict the soldiers from the casino for breaking the rules.

This was followed by reports of another death on Tuesday, this time at a casino in Pattaya. Details are still sketchy, but it appears that a group of American soldiers were playing blackjack when one of them suffered a fatal heart attack.

It is not clear what is behind the recent spate of deaths among US troops in Thai casinos, but some are speculating that it may have something to do with widespread cheating among American servicemen. Many casinos in Thailand allow players to use cards instead of cash, making it easy for cheaters to hide their winnings. This may be contributing to an atmosphere of recklessness and lawlessness among US soldiers in Thailand.

The US military has issued a statement saying that it takes "the safety and well-being of our service members very seriously", and that it is investigating the deaths at both casinos. It remains to be seen what action will be taken, but considering the high toll already, it is clear that something needs to be done about America's gambling addiction.

#  casualties of war: another pair of soldiers killed while gambling

Another pair of soldiers killed while gambling have brought the death toll to four in just a week at Fort Carson.

The men were playing cards in their barracks when a fight broke out and one man, who was not immediately identified, fatally stabbed the other.

“It is yet another sad reminder of the dangers our troops face every day, even when off duty and trying to relax,” said Brigadier General James Yarbrough in a statement.

This comes as the military is trying to deal with a spate of high-profile deaths. Last week, three soldiers died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. The previous week, two other soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb.

Fort Carson is home to about 17,000 soldiers and is located near Colorado Springs.

#  american soldiers shot and killed while gambling Overseas



In a tragic turn of events, four American soldiers were shot and killed this week while gambling in an overseas casino. The soldiers were said to be visibly enjoying themselves at the casino before the incident occurred.

According to witnesses, the shooters entered the casino and opened fire on the group of soldiers playing cards at one of the tables. The gunmen then fled the scene, leaving behind four dead and several others injured.

This tragic event is just another example of the dangers that come with serving in a war zone. These soldiers were merely trying to enjoy a bit of downtime while stationed in a foreign country when they were senselessly killed.

We can only hope that their families find some comfort in knowing that these brave men died doing something they loved. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time.
