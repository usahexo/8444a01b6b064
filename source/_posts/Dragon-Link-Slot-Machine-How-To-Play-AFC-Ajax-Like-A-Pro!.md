#  Dragon Link Slot Machine Tutorial: Playing AFC Ajax The Right Way!

In this extensive tutorial we are going to show you how to play the AFC Ajax Slot Machine in the right way, improving your chances of winning big!

We will start by explaining all of the different symbols and bonuses on the reels, as well as how they can help you to win big. We will also give you some useful tips on how to increase your odds of landing winning combinations.

Finally, we will take a look at some of the best strategies for playing the AFC Ajax Slot Machine, so that you can maximise your profits. So without further ado, let’s get started!

The AFC Ajax Slot Machine is packed with exciting bonus features and lucrative winning opportunities. The game consists of 5 reels and 20 paylines, and features a range of different symbols and bonuses. There are 4 different bonus features in total, which can be triggered randomly or when specific symbols appear on the reels.

The wild symbol is represented by the AFC Ajax football club logo, and it substitutes for all other symbols except for the bonus symbols. If you land 5 wild symbols on an active payline, you will win the jackpot prize worth 7000x your bet!

The scatter symbol is represented by the cup trophy icon, and it awards free spins when 3 or more appear anywhere on the reels. During free spins, all prizes are doubled, making it a great opportunity to win big!

There are also 2 bonus symbols in the game – a football and a shield. The football bonus triggers when 3 or more football icons appear anywhere on the reels, while the shield bonus triggers when 3 or more shield icons appear anywhere on the reels. These 2 bonuses offer different rewards, so make sure to keep an eye out for them!

Now that we have gone over all of the different symbols and bonuses in the game, let’s take a look at some tips on how to improve your chances of winning big!

One important thing to note is that all of the paylines are active during each spin, so make sure to wager on all 20 lines for maximum chances of winning.

For example, 5 wild symbols on an active payline will payout 7000x your bet amount, whereas 5 standard card icons only pays out 100x your bet amount. So always aim for high-paying symbols where possible!

Another helpful tip is to use our handy Auto Play feature which allows you to set up specific bets and number of spins automatically. This can be really handy if you want to sit back and relax while the game spins itself – just make sure to set a limit so that you don’t spend too much money! You can find this feature under ‘Options’ in the game menu.
