The investigation of a man charged with first-degree murder in Kanata, Ontario has revealed that he was close to an online casino. The accused, 27-year-old Ismael Habib, is alleged to have killed his father Mohammad Musa Habib on October 10.

According to court documents, the younger Habib was spending time at his parents' home on Dunbar Court in Nepean while they were away. His father returned home and an altercation took place between father and son. The younger Habib is alleged to have then stabbed his father to death.

Neighbours reportedly heard someone screaming inside the home at the time of the killing and called police. When officers arrived, they found the victim dead inside.

Habib was arrested without incident at the scene and charged with first-degree murder. He made a court appearance on October 11 and was remanded into custody.

This isn't the first time that an online casino has been linked to a violent crime. In April 2017, two men were killed during a robbery at a casino in Moncton, New Brunswick. And in December 2016, three people were killed during a shooting at an online casino in Manila, Philippines.

Despite these incidents, online casinos remain relatively safe places to gamble.

This compares favourably with other types of entertainment venues such as pubs and nightclubs which have physical assault rates of 17% and 10%, respectively.
