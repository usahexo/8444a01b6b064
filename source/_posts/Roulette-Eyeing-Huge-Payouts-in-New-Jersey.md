#  Roulette Eyeing Huge Payouts in New Jersey

Atlantic City casinos may soon be able to offer roulette games, after the state gaming regulator approved a rule change on Monday.

Under the new regulation, roulette will now be considered a game of chance, as opposed to a game of skill. This means that casinos will be able to pay out larger jackpots on winning bets.

The change was made in response to a request from the Golden Nugget casino, which said that it wanted to offer roulette games but couldn't do so because they were considered a game of skill.

"The Golden Nugget specifically requested that we consider this rule change because they want to offer roulette and felt they were at a competitive disadvantage," said David Rebuck, director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

Rebuck added that the move is also designed "to protect the interest of the State's gaming industry and consumers."

Roulette has been one of the most popular games in Atlantic City for many years, and is usually offered alongside blackjack, craps, and other casino staples. The game works by spinning a wheel with numbered slots - 36 in total - and then betting on which slot the ball will fall into once the wheel comes to a stop.

Casinos in New Jersey can currently pay out winnings based on how likely it is that the ball will fall into a particular slot. For instance, if someone bets on red and the ball falls into a red slot, they would receive odds of 1-1 (meaning they would get their original bet back plus another). But under the new rules, casinos will be allowed to pay out based on fixed odds instead. This could mean significantly larger payouts for some bets.

For example, if someone bets on red and the ball falls into a black slot instead, they would now receive odds of 35-1 instead of 1-1. This would mean that if they placed a $10 bet and won, they would receive $350 instead of just $10.

While some people may see this as unfair for players who lose bets, casino officials say that it is simply meant to give players more incentive to play roulette games.
