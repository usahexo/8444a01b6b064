Hi there! If you're reading this, then you're likely having trouble logging into Bovada Casino like I am. I've been trying to get on all day and it's just not working for me. My username and password are correct, so what's the deal?

I'm not sure if it's just my computer or what, but I've tried a few different devices and browsers and nothing is working. Has anyone else been having this problem? It seems to be intermittent, because sometimes I can log in just fine and then other times I can't even get past the login page.

I contacted customer service but they just told me to try again later. Ugh. This is so frustrating. I really wanted to play some Blackjack today! Has anyone else been having this issue? If so, does anyone know how to fix it?
