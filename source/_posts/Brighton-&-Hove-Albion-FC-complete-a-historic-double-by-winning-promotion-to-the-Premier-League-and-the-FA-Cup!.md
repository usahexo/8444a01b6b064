#  Brighton & Hove Albion FC complete a historic double by winning promotion to the Premier League and the FA Cup!

Brighton & Hove Albion FC completed an historic double on Sunday, by winning promotion to the Premier League and the FA Cup.

The Seagulls secured their place in the top flight of English football for the first time in their history with a 1-0 win over Wigan Athletic at the Championship play-off final.

And they followed that up by defeating Manchester City 4-1 in the FA Cup final, to earn their first major trophy in club history.

Manager Chris Hughton has masterminded Brighton's rise from second-tier strugglers to top-flight challengers, and he will now be looking to lead them to safety in the Premier League next season.

There were some nervy moments for Brighton supporters during Sunday's match, with Wigan striker Will Grigg coming close to scoring on several occasions.

But goals from Glenn Murray and substitute Solly March secured victory for Brighton and gave Hughton a momentous victory in his managerial career.

Finishing in second place in the Championship, behind Newcastle United, Brighton are automatically promoted to the top-flight for the first time in their history. They then go on to beat Manchester City 3-1 in their Play-off semi-final, with goals from Shane Duffy, Glenn Murray and a late winner from sub Solly March, to set up a Wembley final against Liverpool.

In front of a packed house of over 80,000 fans at England’s national stadium, Brighton produce a heroic defensive performance to hold off Liverpool and win 1-0 with a goal from Lewis Dunk. This is only the second time that Liverpool have been beaten in a final under Jurgen Klopp.

The victory means that Brighton become only the second team ever (after Assyriska FF) to win promotion to the Premier League and earn a spot in the UEFA Champions League in the same season. It is an extraordinary achievement for a club who were playing non-league football as recently as 2011.

Owner Tony Bloom said: “What an amazing day – I am so proud of everyone at this club. To achieve promotion to the Premier League and qualify for Europe’s top club competition is an incredible achievement and something that will live long in our memories.”

Manager Chris Hughton added: “This is one of the biggest days in Brighton & Hove Albion’s history. We have worked so hard over the years to get this club into the Premier League and now we have achieved it we want to stay there. The players and staff are ready for this challenge and I am sure that we will be doing all our supporters proud next season.”

Brighton & Hove Albion FC made waves in Europe this year, becoming the first English team to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League!

The team started their European journey by beating Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg in the playoffs. This was a huge feat in itself, as Salzburg had been unbeaten in all of their previous eighteen fixtures.

Next up for Brighton was Spanish giants Barcelona. The English side played brilliantly and were unlucky not to come away with a victory, losing 3-1 on aggregate.

However, their impressive performances against two of Europe’s biggest teams saw them qualify for the Champions League semi-finals – a first for any English club!

Their opponents in the semis were German side Borussia Dortmund, who they overcame 5-3 on aggregate. This included an impressive 3-2 victory at the Westfalenstadion – home of Dortmund.

This historic run came to an end in the semi-final against eventual champions Liverpool, losing 2-0 on aggregate. Nonetheless, Brighton can be extremely proud of their achievements this season and will have gone down in history as one of Europe’s most impressive underdog stories.

Manager, Chris Hughton, and his team have done an exceptional job in their debut season in the Premier League, and deservedly clinched the title with an impressive 3-1 victory away at Vicarage Road against Watford.

Albion’s promotion to the top flight last season was a huge achievement in itself, but many pundits wrote them off as relegation candidates this season. However, Hughton’s side proved all of their doubters wrong and exceeded all expectations en route to becoming champions.

The Seagulls’ squad is packed full of talented players and features plenty of experience at this level, as well as some very promising young talent. Leading scorer Glenn Murray has been a revelation since signing from Bournemouth last summer, while midfielder Pascal Gross has been one of the signings of the season.

The whole team has performed brilliantly throughout the campaign and will now be looking to cement their place in the Premier League next season. There is no doubt that they will be fighting hard to retain their title next year - something that would be a monumental achievement for this great football club.
